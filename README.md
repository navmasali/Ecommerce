Regression: Prediction of important marketing channels on sales
Problem Statement: 
ElecKart is an e-commerce firm specializing in electronic products. Over the last one year, they had spent a significant amount of money in marketing. Occasionally, they had also offered big-ticket promotions (similar to the Big Billion Day). They are about to create a marketing budget for the next year which includes spending on commercials, online campaigns, and pricing & promotion strategies. The CFO feels that the money spent over last 12 months on marketing was not sufficiently successful, and, that they can either cut on the budget or reallocate it optimally across marketing levers to improve the revenue response.

Contribution:
I worked on combining multiple data sets for the analysis, carried out data exploration and cleaning. Analyzed and predicted the sales and major variables of advertising media channels for E-commerce giant Flipkart using R by Linear, Distributed Lag + Multiplicative Models to optimize the budget allocation by 25% on prospective profitable marketing channels, used Tableau for Visualization.
